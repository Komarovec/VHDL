2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock hdmi_inst/fastclocking/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_clk_25MHz and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock hdmi_inst/fastclocking/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_clk_25MHz_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz and clk_out1_clk_250MHz_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_250MHz_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz and clk_out1_clk_25MHz_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz_1 and clk_out1_clk_250MHz_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_250MHz_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#4 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz_1 and clk_out1_clk_25MHz are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz and clk_out1_clk_250MHz_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_250MHz_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz_1 and clk_out1_clk_250MHz_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_25MHz_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_250MHz_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock hdmi_inst/fastclocking/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin hdmi_inst/fastclocking/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin pixcloking/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_clk_25MHz, clkfbout_clk_25MHz_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin pixcloking/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_clk_25MHz, clk_out1_clk_25MHz_1
