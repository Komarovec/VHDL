2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_3 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#1 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks design_1_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/DRCK and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_3 (see constraint position 6 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#2 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks design_1_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/UPDATE and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_3 (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '20' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
